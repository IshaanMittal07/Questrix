# Decisions

A running log of choices made where the plan was ambiguous or where current tooling differed from it.

## Phase 0

- **Repository visibility:** the repo `IshaanMittal07/Questrix` already existed and is **public**, so it was reused instead of running `gh repo create`. Because it's public, branch protection is available.
- **Typecheck script:** `next typegen && tsc --noEmit` instead of plain `tsc --noEmit`. Next 16 generates global route types (`LayoutProps`, `PageProps`) into `.next/types`, and a clean CI checkout doesn't have them until `next typegen` runs.
- **jsdom pinned to ^29:** jsdom 30+ requires Node ≥ 22.22.2. The local machine runs Node 22.14, and jsdom 29 supports `^22.13`. CI runs Node 22 (`.nvmrc`). Bump to the latest jsdom once local Node is upgraded.
- **Supabase CLI as a devDependency** (`supabase` npm package, run with `pnpm exec supabase` or the `db:*` scripts), so the version is pinned in the lockfile. CI uses `supabase/setup-cli` with the same version.
- **Line endings:** `.gitattributes` forces LF and Prettier uses `endOfLine: lf`, so Windows checkouts and CI agree.
- **Plan copies:** `QUESTRIX_BUILD_PLAN.md` (the original) stays at the root and `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md` is the maintained copy, as plan §10 asks. Both are excluded from Prettier so they stay verbatim.
- **create-next-app extras:** Next 16's scaffold adds `AGENTS.md` (Next.js agent rules, which say to read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before coding), enables `cacheComponents` and `partialPrefetching`, and uses `@tailwindcss/turbopack`. All of these are kept as generated.
- **pgTAP smoke test** (`supabase/tests/000_smoke.sql`) exists so `supabase test db` has something to run before Phase 2 adds real tables.
